## Technical Requirements
---------------
Problem: I love going to the gym, but I have such a busy schedule so I do not have the time to meet up with a personal trainer. I also suffer from "gym anxiety" so it is ideal for me to have a plan before entering the gym. 

General App Idea: An app that allows me to target and organize what workouts I will complete by a weekly, or monthly basis. 

Who Would Use It: Gym users of all levels, who enjoy staying organzied and need one less thing to worry about at the gym. 
### What's Next/ Stretch Goals?
- Adding video tutorial pages that explain to the user how to do their workout of choice
- Improve CSS/ overall flow of the app
- A Third Party API, for users to have access to other workout routines that may not be listed on the app
- Turning the app into a Work Out Tracker, where users have the option of jotting down their results, sucess and obstacles during the duriation of their workout. 
- Users having the opprotunity to create an in app profile 
- Adding an third party API
### Known Bugs?
- Currently users are not able individually edit either own workouts and add their set numbers with the edit button 
- The description does not appear on the show me page, even after user has made the selection. 
- Currently users can only edit the date, image and excercise of their workout in the edit tab.
